# 🧮 Java Calculator

 
This is a simple **Java-based Calculator** project that demonstrates:  
- Basic arithmetic operations  
- Input validation with `try-catch`  
- Formatted output (integers and decimals)  
- Looping until user exits  
- Graceful handling of division/modulo by zero  

It’s a **beginner-friendly project** and a great practice for anyone learning **Java fundamentals**.
